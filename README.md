# Prisma Bridg EA Quickstart
A quick-start template using Prisma Bridg.

This project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and [`prisma init`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)

## Setup
### 1. Clone repo
```shell
git clone 
cd bridg-ea-quickstart
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```shell
npm install
```

### 4. Run
```shell
npm run dev
```
You should see an empty chat interface.

Prisma Bridg works seamlessly with Prisma Accelerate and Prisma Pulse. Let's enable them.

Navigate to your Prisma Data Platform account and create a new project. Let's call it, Prisma Bridg Chat.
This will create a default environment for your project.

Next, we'll enable Accelerate and Pulse for this project.

*If you need a database to complete this setup, you can use our [Railway DB template](https://railway.app/template/pulse-pg) to easily provision a Postgres database.

### 5. Enable Accelerate
- Provide your direct database connection and select a region to enable Accelerate. We'll skip static IP support for demo purposes.
- Once enabled, you'll be able to Generate an API Key for Accelerate. You'll note the API Key was generated in the format of a connection string, use this as your DATABASE_URL in your .env file.

```shell
DATABASE_URL=""
```

When replacing your DATABASE_URL with your new Accelerate connection string, be sure to add your direct database connection string to DIRECT_DATABASE_URL. This is used for migrations.

### 6. Enable Pulse
- Navigate to the Pulse tab within your project's production environment (where we just enabled Accelerate)
- Provide your direct database connection and select a region to enable Pulse. We'll use the automatic setup.
- Once enabled, you'll be able to Generate an API Key for Pulse. Add the generated API Key to your .env file

```shell
PULSE_API_KEY=""
```

Great! You've now enabled Prisma Accelerate and Prisma Pulse for your project. Let's add Prisma Bridg to our application

### 7. Add Prisma Bridg
From within your project directory, run the following command to add Prisma Bridg to your project.

```shell
npx bridg-cli init
```

This will do the following for you,
1. Install remaining dependencies
2. Generate the bridg-server.ts and bridg.ts files for you
3. Deploy your managed Bridg endpoint

You're all set ðŸš€  Let's see how we can use Prisma Bridg to power our chat application.

### Add Bridg to your application
Navigate to `/src/app/page.tsx`and import Bridg at the top of the file.

```tsx
import bridg from "bridg";
```

Add the following code to the `useEffect` hook in the `Home` function.

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  (async () => {
    /**
     * Bridg supports any authentication method you want to use.
     * Simply add your authentication logic in bridg-server.ts.
     */
    await bridg.$socket.authenticate({ auth: "some-token" });

    // Fetch any existing message from the database
    await bridg.message.findMany().then((res) => setMessages(res));

    // Let's create a new subscription to capture any new messages
    // @ts-ignore
    const subscription = await bridg.message.subscribe();
    for await (const event of subscription) {
      setEvents((prev) => [...prev, event]);
    }
  })();
}, []);
```

Replace the `<Button />` alert with the following code to send new messages.

```tsx
<Button className="ml-2" onClick={() => bridg.message.create({ data: { body: newMessage } })}>Send</Button>
```
